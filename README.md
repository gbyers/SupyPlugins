# SupyPlugins
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/GLolol/SupyPlugins.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/GLolol/SupyPlugins)

My collection of plugins for [Supybot/Limnoria](https://github.com/ProgVal/Limnoria). This repository is provided **AS IS**, **without any warranty**! It may glitch, break, or spontaneously combust at any time. You have been warned!

## Installation
The recommended way of fetching plugins in this repository is to clone the git repository:

* `$ git clone https://github.com/GLolol/SupyPlugins`

and adding the folder to your bot's `config directories.plugins`.

**You will need a working copy of [Limnoria](https://github.com/ProgVal/Limnoria) running on Python 2.7 or Python 3.2+.** Anything older will *not* work.

If you are using a recent version of Limnoria's PluginDownloader, you can also fetch [individual plugins](#list-of-plugins) by running:

* `install GLolol <plugin>`

on your bot.

## Support
If you have any questions, concerns, or feature requests, please feel free to submit an issue. Pull requests are welcome.

Or, you can find me on IRC at: `irc.overdrive.pw #dev` ([webchat](http://webchat.overdrive.pw/?channels=dev))

## License
Unless otherwise noted, all plugins are available under a 3 clause BSD license (inserted at the top of each file).

## List of plugins
Please note that this list may not always be up to date; your best bet is to actually browse the code for yourself! Any specific plugin dependencies should also be listed.
